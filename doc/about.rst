|command| is command line tool written in Python. It checks given repository against provided rules to ensure that Gitflow is respected.

What is Gitflow? `Based on Atlassian: <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow>`__

    The Gitflow Workflow defines a **strict branching model** designed around the project release. This provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.

    [...]

    It assigns **very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact**. In addition to feature branches, it uses individual branches for preparing, maintaining, and recording releases.

As they wrote: *Gitflow is ideally suited for projects that have a scheduled release cycle*. It means that Gitflow is not always recommended, but when it is, you'd better stick to the rules!

And this is when |command| can help ;-)
